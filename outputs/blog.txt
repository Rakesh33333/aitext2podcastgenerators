Small lifestyle changes can make a big difference for the environment. Reducing single-use plastics, conserving water, and using public transport can help reduce our carbon footprint. Switching to energy-efficient appliances, using LED bulbs, and turning off unused devices can significantly reduce household energy use. Eating locally-sourced and seasonal foods, reducing meat consumption, and minimizing food waste contribute to a healthier planet.
